When saving a kst session the fileRelative paths for the data files are always
saved relative to the current working directory rather than relative to the kst
session file itself.

When kst is started from the start menu the current working directory is the
directory in which the kst bin directory is located and does not change when
the kst session file is saved.

When kst is started by double clicking on a kst session file the current
working directory is the same as the kst session file so all fileRelative paths
appear to be relative to the kst session file.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Kst from icon in start menu
2. Save empty session in same directory as data file
3. Import data file using wizard or any other method
4. Save session again

Actual Results:  
If I have a data file located at "C:\David\Visualisation\KST Tests\formatted
date times\data1.csv" and then save a kst session file that uses that data as
"C:\David\Visualisation\KST Tests\formatted date times\kst.kst" then the
fileRelative path is stored as "../../David/Visualisation/KST Tests/formatted
date times/data1.csv".

This means that if you move the files (session & data) to another location or
transfer to another computer then the relative path is incorrect and when the
session is loaded the user gets prompted that Kst cannot find the files and
they need to locate the correct path.


Expected Results:  
I would have expected the fileRelative path to be stored as "data1.csv",
meaning that the data is relative to the kst session file and that moving those
files together would still allow them to be found.

We have a data source file where we log temperatures. The unit in this case is °C (alt-167).

When plotting this, the axis labels get a ? in a black box. When adding an Annotation or changing the ? black box in the label dialogue, we can enter alt-167 and get the correct º Symbol.

FEATURES

F3. Text labels have no background fill properties.

F4. Nicer date tick marks.

F5. Vector-choosing boxes should autocomplete.  i.e., if I have only one vector
    derived from AZ_MAG (called, say, "AZ_MAG (V21)"), then I want to be able to
    select that by typing "AZ_MAG" in the vector box, and not all of "AZ_MAG
    (V21)".  (This is because users don't have any clue what the vector number
    of the vector they want is.)

F6. Non-integer curve stroke width.

F9. Forward and back in smaller steps than whole screen.

F11. Listfile subset

F12. For fits, provide an (optional?) vector to evaluate over.

F13. Set sample range defaults from scripting
