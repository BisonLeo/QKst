BUGS

Bug 394448

What I did:
1. Load a small ASCII data file with the data wizard, and create a plot
2. Save to new .kst file and close kst
3. Start kst and open this .kst file again
4. Go to change data file dialog and select a different ASCII file, click ok
5. Go to change data file dialog again, select the ASCII file from step 1.

What I expected: The data file from step 1 should be accepted and plotted, because the file is ok and still in its location.

What happened: The file is not accepted, the program returns: "The file could not be loaded or contains no data."

I downloaded the latest source code and traced the message back to method ChangeFileDialog::apply(), where the message box is created upon !_dataSource->isValid().

The _isValid attribute is false, because it is set to false by call to method reset() in AsciiSource::parseProperties. This method is called when the .kst file is loaded, after creation of the AsciiSource.

I removed the call to reset() and the problem dissapeared. I did not create a patch because I'm not sure about side effects.

We have a data source file where we log temperatures. The unit in this case is °C (alt-167).

When plotting this, the axis labels get a ? in a black box. When adding an Annotation or changing the ? black box in the label dialogue, we can enter alt-167 and get the correct º Symbol.

Bug 318141

When double clicking on an element in the available or selected list in the "Differentiate Curves" dialog nothing happens. It should trigger an add or remove action depending on the list in which the item resides. This is a bug because the behavior is inconsistent with other dialogs, which have the same layout (e.g. Data Wizard)

Reproducible: Always

What I did:
- create three plots, and place two in a shared axis box
- tie x-zoom for all three plots (Ctrl-t)
- click on one plot in the shared axis box to select it, and press e-key
- in "edit plot item" dialog, goto "Range/Zoom" page, check "Y Zoom Mode" = fixed and change the range values, click ok

What I expected to happen:
- the y-axis range of the selected plot should change to the new values

What actually happened:
- the y-axis range of all three plots changed to the new values


The problem seems to dissapear if I remove following lines from method 
void SharedAxisBoxItem::zoomYRange(const QRectF &projection, PlotItem* originPlotItem):
foreach(PlotItem* plotItem, plotTied) {
  plotItem->zoomYRange(projection, true);
}

I would like to use the shared axis box for plotting 10 to 20 binary signals in one box, and have another plot on the tab showing signals with wider range, so the shared axis is really good to save a lot of space!

pykst: accept non-float64 numpy arrays.

dirfile reader should recognise "format" if it is valid.

FEATURES

F3. Text labels have no background fill properties.

F4. Nicer date tick marks.

F5. Vector-choosing boxes should autocomplete.  i.e., if I have only one vector
    derived from AZ_MAG (called, say, "AZ_MAG (V21)"), then I want to be able to
    select that by typing "AZ_MAG" in the vector box, and not all of "AZ_MAG
    (V21)".  (This is because users don't have any clue what the vector number
    of the vector they want is.)

F6. Non-integer curve stroke width.

F9. Forward and back in smaller steps than whole screen.

F11. Listfile subset

F12. For fits, provide an (optional?) vector to evaluate over.

F13. Set sample range defaults from scripting

F14. Verify that meta scalars work in dirfiles.
