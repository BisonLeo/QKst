BUGS

FEATURES
F1. A way of printing nicely C times in text labels (being able to specify,
     say, a strftime format string would be great)

F3. Text labels have no background fill properties.

F4. Nicer date tick marks.

F5. Vector-choosing boxes should autocomplete.  i.e., if I have only one vector
    derived from AZ_MAG (called, say, "AZ_MAG (V21)"), then I want to be able to
    select that by typing "AZ_MAG" in the vector box, and not all of "AZ_MAG
    (V21)".  (This is because users don't have any clue what the vector number
    of the vector they want is.)

F6. Non-integer curve stroke width.

F9. Forward and back in smaller steps than whole screen.

F11. Listfile subset

F12. For fits, provide an (optional?) vector to evaluate over.

F13. Set sample range defaults from scripting

F14. Verify that meta scalars work in dirfiles.
